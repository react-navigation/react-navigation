            **The best way to get attention to your issue is to provide an easy way for a developer to reproduce the issue.**

            You can provide a repro using any of the following:

            - [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io)
            - [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)
            - GitHub repo under your username

            A snack link is preferred since it's the easiest way to both create and share a repro. If it's not possible to create a repro using a snack, link to a GitHub repo under your username is a good alternative. **Don't link to a branch or specific file etc.** as it won't be detected.

            Try to keep the repro as small as possible by narrowing down the minimal amount of code needed to reproduce the issue. **Don't link to your entire project or a project containing code unrelated to the issue.** See ["How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) for more information.

            You can edit your original issue to include a link to the repro, or leave it as a comment. **The issue will be closed automatically after a while** if you don't provide a repro.`

              const comments = await github.issues.listComments({
                issue_number: context.issue.number,
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
              });

              if (comments.data.some((comment) => comment.body === body)) {
                return;
              }

              await github.issues.createComment({
                issue_number: context.issue.number,
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                body,
              });

              await github.issues.addLabels({
                issue_number: context.issue.number,
                owner: context.repo.owner,
                repo: context.repo.repo,
                labels: ['needs repro'],
              });
            }
